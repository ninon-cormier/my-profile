           <p> 
             Hi, my name is <strong>Ninon Cormier</strong>. I am 18 since January 18, so soon I will be 19. My three hobbies are travelling, clothes fashion and food! However, of course I love going out with my friends, having fun partying, listening to music and above all sleeping !
             I live in Poissy with my family. This summer I got my driving license and I'm very proud of it (now I'm my brothers' taxi ;)).
             Moreover, as far as my education is concerned, I am in my first year of business school at the Leonard de Vinci Management School in La Défense.
           </p>

          <h2><b>Travel</b></h2>
          <p>I am conscious to be a lucky person because I have been travelling all around the world with my family, since my childhood.
         All these trips I have done, made me discover new cultures, new languages and new horizons which made me evolve and grow.
         Among my most beautiful trips, I can mention Greece, Bali and its surrounding islands such as Sulawesi, Egypt, the Seychelles ...
         For the future, I wish I could go on travelling and if possible, make discover marvellous lands to the family of my own. </p>

          <h2><b>Fashion</b></h2>
          <p>I love dressing up.
            Every evening I prepare my outfit for the next day. It allows me to express myself and feel good.
            My own device : one day, one style.
            A jogging, a pair of jeans, baskets or boots, a coat or a jacket... it depends on my mood and my desire.
            I also adore watching fashion shows like Chanel, Jacquemus or Dior ones but unfortunately I have never been there myself.
            But I don't give up hope, it will happen one day;)</p>

          <h2><b>Food</b></h2>
          <p>As a told previously, I love eating. It's my cute sin. I wish I had another one because to stay in shape it is not the easy way to be so greedy ;).
          I eat everything, whether Chinese, Indian, Italian, Asian food or even junk food such as Mc'Donalds, everything is good to try !
          As far as I am concerned, the expression "eat to live" is totally wrong! 
          In my case I live to eat ;)</p>

          <p>As I said above, I live with my family. we are 5.
             I have 2 little brothers, Raphaël who is 16 years old and Stanislas who is 12 years old. My father, Franck, and my mother, Flore.
